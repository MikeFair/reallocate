Devolution and the formation of 47 semi-autonomous counties is viewed as a way to increase democratic processes and reduce corruption. Existing sources of information about public administration and service delivery focus entirely on the national level. While there are national level sources of information in Kenya, there are not similar sources of information that focus on the new counties, themselves. Picture the difficulties you would have, with very limited access to information about public administration and local service delivery in the place where you live! "
