Program Areas

ReAllocate supports three program areas that intertwine to create an infrastructure that supports sustainable development through education, ecosystems, equality, and economics.

			<h2>Innovation Centers</h2>
		</div>
	</div>

<p>
ReAllocate's capacity building initiative. Innovation Centers provide resources, expertise and training for sustainable economic and community development. Local facilities are converted into workshops, equipped with modules needed to create a development base (internet enabled computer labs, health centers, energy generation sites, etc.). These centers serve as hubs for 10-week intensive innovation programs where in-country fellows are paired one-on-one with expert mentors and coached though rapid prototyping, market testing and building a social business model.
</p>

<p>
The trials of these innovative local start ups are documented and published online. A member of each cohort receives digital media training and follows each fellow through their trials and tribulations. The failures and successes are documented and provide fellows with a succinct video pitch for impact investing. Fellows are given direct follow up support for a period of time as they incubate their businesses.
</p>

ReAllocate Alaska will be the site of the first ReAllocate Innovation Center.
Tech-AID 

TechAID is Technology Assessment Innovation and Delivery. ReAllocate accepts requests from nonprofits for technological assistance. The requests and organizations are vetted before entering into the Tech-Aid program. ReAllocate only engages projects with clearly defined technical obstacles from credible organizations. After acceptance, a team of ReAllocators are specifically chosen, assigned to the project, equipped with the tools and resources they need provided by our sponsors, and move through the Tech-Aid design process to deliver a user driven solution.

Education Access

The Education Access program pairs experienced engineers, technologists, artists and other "making" professionals with youth in our local community using a classic one-on-one mentorship model.  These hands-on experiences introduce students to professional fields, while at the same time providing a mentorship experience through being part of problem solving - working projects that have a direct impact on current world issues.  The mentor relationship enables leading edge experts to provide guidance that is accessible, intriguing and encouraging for these students. The direct involvement builds a sense of accomplishment driving their future endeavors, creativity and motivation to become leaders and problem solvers in their lives.
